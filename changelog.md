This update adds a config option (which is on by default) to disallow Curse of Binding items in vanity slots.

Some gravestone mods put items back in your inventory exactly how they were when you died, meaning that Curse of Binding items get stuck in your vanity slots forever (since they can't take durability, either), so this config option should prevent that from happening in the first place!

For people who've already put Curse of Binding in their vanity slots, try something like `/trinkets set head vanity 0 air`.
